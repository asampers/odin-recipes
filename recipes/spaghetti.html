    <h2>Do <em>Not</em> Miss Your Chance!</h2>
    <p>Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity to seize everything
        you ever wanted in one moment...would you capture it, or just let
        it slip? Yo!</p>
    <p>This is the spaghetti recipe your mom uses. It's the only
        spaghetti recipe you'll ever need.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 lb. spaghetti pasta</li>
        <li>1 (28-oz.) can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 to 3 tablespoons olive oil <em>extra virgin</em></li>
        <li>3 to 4 cloves garlic <em>smashed*</em></li>
        <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>3 sprigs fresh basil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter <em>cubed</em></li>
        <li>finishing olive oil <em>optional</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make pasta:</strong> <em>Heat a large pot of water, seasoned with 
            salt, and bring to a boil. Cook the spaghetti to al 
            dente. Reserve a cup of pasta water before draining. 
            Drain and set aside.</em></li>
        <p> </p>
        <li><strong>Prep the tomatoes:</strong> <em>using a slotted spoon, remove the whole 
            tomatoes from the can and into a bowl. Do not toss the tomato 
            sauce in the can. We will use that later! Remove the seeds if you 
            prefer. Set aside.</em></li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Using a large skillet with high sides, heat the olive oil over medium 
            heat. Add the garlic and cook, stirring often with a wooden spoon, until garlic is golden all 
            over, for about 3 minutes.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Stir in the crushed red pepper flakes and then add in the smashed tomatoes and increase the 
            heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until tomatoes have darkened in 
            color a bit, for about 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Pour in the reserved tomato liquid from the can and stir to combine. Season with a pinch of 
            salt, add in the basil sprigs, and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring 
            occasionally, until liquid is reduced and sauce is thick like applesauce, for about 
            8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Add in the cooked spaghetti, and using tongs, start tossing together constantly 
            until the spaghetti is all nicely coated in the sauce. If you need it, add a just a 
            little splash of the pasta cooking water. Add in the butter and toss some more until 
            the butter is melted and incorporated.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Divide the pasta into bowls and serve!</li>
