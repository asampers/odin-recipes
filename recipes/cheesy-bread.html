    <!-- Description of the Recipe -->
    <h2>Bread, Cheese, and Butter!</h2>
    <p><strong>Naples34102</strong> says: <em>"Wouldn't have this often 
        as it's heavy and rich and clearly not the best nutrition-wise 
        either. But as an occasional splurge in small portions this 
        was a mouth-watering, gooey, cheesy treat to accompany our main 
        dish salad tonight."</em></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>¾ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onions, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
        <li>1 (1 pound) loaf French bread, halved lengthwise</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an oven to <strong>350 degrees F</strong> (175 degrees C).</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Combine the butter, mayonnaise, green onions, garlic, 
            Parmesan cheese, and Monterey Jack cheese in a large bowl. 
            Cut each half of French bread into 4 pieces. Spread the 
            cheese mixture evenly on the bread pieces.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes. Set the oven to
