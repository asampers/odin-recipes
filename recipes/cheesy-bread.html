    <!-- Description of the Recipe -->
    <h2>Bread, Cheese, and Butter!</h2>
    <p><strong>Naples34102</strong> says: <em>"Wouldn't have this often 
        as it's heavy and rich and clearly not the best nutrition-wise 
        either. But as an occasional splurge in small portions this 
        was a mouth-watering, gooey, cheesy treat to accompany our main 
        dish salad tonight."</em></p>
