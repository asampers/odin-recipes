    <p><strong>Alley1403</strong> says: <em>"The most amazing tiramisu 
        I've ever had! I like that only eggs and mascarpone are used 
        and not the whipped cream replacement that 
        I often see. I find this very important.</em></p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Â½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>3 eggs, separated</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons brandy</li>
        <li>2 cups brewed espresso, cooled, divided</li>
        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>1 pinch white sugar</li>
        <li>30 ladyfingers</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat 1/2 cup sugar, egg yolks, brandy, and 1 
            tablespoon espresso together in a bowl using an 
            electric mixer until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. Add 
            mascarpone cheese to sugar-egg mixture and beat 
            until well blended, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Beat egg whites and a pinch sugar in a bowl 
            using an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. 
            Gently fold egg whites into mascarpone mixture.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Pour remaining espresso into a shallow dish. Dip 1 
            side of each ladyfinger into the espresso and arrange 
            on a serving platter in 2 horizontal rows of 6 with 
            2 1/2 ladyfingers in opposite direction on both ends 
            to form a rectangular shape.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture onto the ladyfinger 
            layer and dust with 1/2 of the cocoa powder. Repeat with 
            remaining ladyfingers dipped in espresso, mascarpone 
            mixture, and cocoa powder. Refrigerate tiramisu until 
            ladyfingers have softened from the espresso and mascarpone 
            mixture, 2 to 3 hours.</li>
    </ol>
